# Security Improvements for Telegram Userbot TMA

## 1. CORS Configuration
- **Before**: `allow_origins=["*"]` (allows all origins)
- **After**: `allow_origins=["https://t.me"]` (only allows Telegram Web Apps domain)
- **Impact**: Significantly reduces CSRF attack surface by only allowing requests from trusted domain

## 2. Input Validation
- Added field validators in Pydantic models for:
  - Group identifiers (format and length validation)
  - Message text (length and XSS pattern validation)
  - Configuration keys/values (format, length, and XSS validation)
  - Blacklist entries (format and length validation)
- Added duplicate validation logic at repository level for defense in depth

## 3. Session Encryption
- Enhanced SessionManager to use persistent encryption key from environment variable
- Added `SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to environment variables
- Previously, a new encryption key was generated on each app start, making stored sessions unusable

## 4. Rate Limiting
- Implemented rate limiting using slowapi
- Applied limits to all public API endpoints:
  - Authentication endpoints: more restrictive limits
  - Bulk operations: special limits
  - General endpoints: default limit (100 requests/minute)

## 5. Rate Limiting Implementation
- Added middleware configuration
- Updated API routes to include rate limiting decorators
- Required updating function signatures to include `request` parameter

## 6. File Cleanup
- Removed duplicate functions in routes.py
- Organized code more systematically

## 7. Additional Security Measures
- Added validation for harmful content patterns in messages and config values
- Implemented strict validation for group identifiers, chat IDs, and other inputs

## 8. Environment Configuration
- Added SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY to example environment file
- Users need to generate a proper Fernet key and encode it in base64

To generate a proper encryption key, run:
```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
import base64

key = Fernet.generate_key()
print(base64.b64encode(key).decode())
```
